# Space-time complexity of computation

1. Define the problem rigorously. Classical erasure, reversible , ....

2. Why is it a PSPACE Complete problem?
3. What is the rigorous difference between NP-Complete and PSPACE-Complete problems? Why are we not certain that PSPACE-Complete problems are not equal to NP-Complete? [Ref1](https://www.quora.com/What-makes-any-NP-complete-problem-a-PSPACE-complete-problem-in-the-complexity-theory-field#:~:text=Every%20problem%20in%20NP%20is,problems%20are%20also%20PSPACE%2Dcomplete.) , [Ref2](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/43723/what-is-practical-difference-between-np-and-pspace-complete).


4. Eventually, we would like to know from the complexity class of this problem whether tree-width related algorithms can help with solving our problem.
