  abstract = {The search for efficient algorithms for register allocation dates back to the time of the first Fortran compiler for the IBM 704. Since then, many variants of the problem have been considered; depending on two factors: (1) the particular model for registers, and (2) the definition of the term ``computation of a program'' e.g. whether values may be computed more than once. We will show that several variants of the register allocation problem for straight line programs are polynomial complete. In particular we consider, (1) the case when each value is computed exactly once, and (2) the case when values may be recomputed as necessary. The completeness of the third problem considered is surprising. A straight line program starts with a set of initial values, and computes intermediate and final values. Suppose, for each value, the register that value must be computed into is preassigned. Then, (3) the problem of determining if there is a computation of the straight line program, that computes values into the assigned registers, is polynomial complete.},

abstract = {Computational complexity is one of the most beautiful fields of modern mathematics, and it is increasingly relevant to other sciences ranging from physics to biology. But this beauty is often buried underneath layers of unnecessary formalism, and exciting recent results like interactive proofs, cryptography, and quantum computing are usually considered too "advanced" to show to the typical student. The aim of this book is to bridge both gaps by explaining the deep ideas of theoretical computer science in a clear and enjoyable fashion, making them accessible to non computer scientists and to computer scientists who finally want to understand what their formalisms are actually telling. This book gives a lucid and playful explanation of the field, starting with P and NP-completeness. The authors explain why the P vs. NP problem is so fundamental, and why it is so hard to resolve. They then lead the reader through the complexity of mazes and games; optimization in theory and practice; randomized algorithms, interactive proofs, and pseudorandomness; Markov chains and phase transitions; and the outer reaches of quantum computing. At every turn, they use a minimum of formalism, providing explanations that are both deep and accessible. The book is intended for graduates and undergraduates, scientists from other areas who have long wanted to understand this subject, and experts who want to fall in love with this field all over again.}

abstract = "A certain pebble game on graphs has been studied in various contexts as a model for the time and space requirements of computations [1,2,3,8]. In this note it is shown that there exists a family of directed acyclic graphs Gn and constants c1, c2, c3 such that (1) Gn has n nodes and each node in Gn has indegree at most 2. (2) Each graph Gn can be pebbled with c1√n pebbles in n moves. (3) Each graph Gn can also be pebbled with c2√n pebbles, c21, but every strategy which achieves this has at least 2c3√n moves.",

Sethi has shown this problem to be NP-hard and Lingas has shown a generalization to be P-space complete. We prove the original problem P-space complete by employing a modification of Lingas's proof. The pebbling problem is one of the few examples of a P-space complete problem not exhibiting any obvious quantifier alternation.},
