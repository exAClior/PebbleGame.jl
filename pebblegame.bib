  abstract = {Trees in an n-node forest are merged according to instructions in a given sequence, while other instructions in the sequence ask for the lowest common ancestor of pairs of nodes. We show that any sequence of \$O(n)\$ such instructions can be processed “on-line” in \$O(n\textbackslash log n)\$ steps on a random access computer.If we can accept our answer “off-line”, that is, no answers need to be produced until the entire sequence of instructions has been seen, then we may perform the task in \$O(n\textbackslash alpha (n))\$ steps, where \$\textbackslash alpha (n)\$ is the very slowly growing inverse Ackermann function defined in [14].A third algorithm solves a problem of intermediate complexity. We require the answers on-line, but we assume that all tree merging instructions precede the information requests. This algorithm requires \$O(n \textbackslash log \textbackslash log n)\$ time.We apply the first on-line algorithm to a problem in code optimization, that of computing immediate dominators in a reducible flow graph. We show how this computation can be performed in \$O(n\textbackslash log n)\$ steps.},

  abstract = {We study the connection between pebble games and complexity.First, we derive complexity results using pebble games.It is shown that three pebble games used for studying computational complexity are equivalent: namely, the two-person pebble game of Dymond-Tompa, the two-person pebble game of Raz-McKenzie, and the one-person reversible pebble game of Bennett have the same pebble costs over any directed acyclic graph.The three pebble games have been used for studying parallel complexity and for proving lower bounds under restricted settings, and we show one more such lower bound on circuit-depth.Second, the pebble costs are applied to proof complexity.Concerning a family of unsatisfiable CNFs called pebbling contradictions, the pebble cost in any of the pebble games controls the scaling of some parameters of resolution refutations.Namely, the pebble cost controls the minimum depth of resolution refutations and the minimum size of tree-like resolution refutations.Finally, we study the space complexity of computing the pebble costs and of computing the minimum depth of resolution refutations.It is PSPACE-complete to compute the pebble cost in any of the three pebble games, and to compute the minimum depth of resolution refutations.},

  abstract = {Pebble games are popular models for analyzing time-space trade-offs. In particular, reversible pebble game strategies are frequently applied in quantum algorithms like Grover’s search to efficiently simulate classical computation on inputs in superposition, as unitary operations are fundamentally reversible. However, the reversible pebble game cannot harness the additional computational power granted by intermediate measurements, which are irreversible. The spooky pebble game, which models interleaved Hadamard basis measurements and adaptive phase corrections, reduces the number of qubits beyond what purely reversible approaches can achieve. While the spooky pebble game does not reduce the total space (bits plus qubits) complexity of the simulation, it reduces the amount of space that must be stored in qubits. We prove asymptotically tight trade-offs for the spooky pebble game on a line with any pebble bound. This in turn gives a tight time-qubit tradeoff for simulating arbitrary classical sequential computation when using the spooky pebble game. For example, for all ε ∈ (0, 1], any classical computation requiring time T and space S can be implemented on a quantum computer using only O(T /ε) gates and O(T εS1−ε) qubits. This improves on the best known bound for the reversible pebble game with that number of qubits, which uses O(21/εT ) gates. For smaller space bounds, we show that the spooky pebble game can simulate arbitrary computation with O(T 1+εS−ε/ε) gates and O(S/ε) qubits whereas any simulation via the reversible pebble game requires Ω(S · (1 + log(T /S))) qubits.},

  abstract = {Computational complexity is one of the most beautiful fields of modern mathematics, and it is increasingly relevant to other sciences ranging from physics to biology. But this beauty is often buried underneath layers of unnecessary formalism, and exciting recent results like interactive proofs, phase transitions, and quantum computing are usually considered too advanced for the typical student. This book bridges these gaps by explaining the deep ideas of theoretical computer science in a clear and enjoyable fashion, making them accessible to non-computer scientists and to computer scientists who finally want to appreciate their field from a new point of view. The authors start with a lucid and playful explanation of the P vs. NP problem, explaining why it is so fundamental, and so hard to resolve. They then lead the reader through the complexity of mazes and games; optimization in theory and practice; randomized algorithms, interactive proofs, and pseudorandomness; Markov chains and phase transitions; and the outer reaches of quantum computing. At every turn, they use a minimum of formalism, providing explanations that are both deep and accessible. The book is intended for graduate and undergraduate students, scientists from other areas who have long wanted to understand this subject, and experts who want to fall in love with this field all over again.},

  abstract = {Pebble games are used to study space/time trade-offs. Recently, spooky pebble games were introduced to study classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs for simulation of classical circuits on quantum computers. In this paper, the spooky pebble game framework is applied for the first time to general circuits. Using this framework we prove an upper bound for quantum space in the spooky pebble game. We also prove that solving the spooky pebble game is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we present a solver for the spooky pebble game based on satisfiability combined with heuristic solvers. This spooky pebble game solver was empirically evaluated by calculating optimal classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs. Within limited runtime, the solver could find a strategy reducing quantum space when classical space is taken into account, showing that the spooky pebble model is useful to reduce quantum space.},

  abstract = {The search for efficient algorithms for register allocation dates back to the time of the first Fortran compiler for the IBM 704. Since then, many variants of the problem have been considered; depending on two factors: (1) the particular model for registers, and (2) the definition of the term “computation of a program” e.g. whether values may be computed more than once. We will show that several variants of the register allocation problem for straight line programs are polynomial complete. In particular we consider, (1) the case when each value is computed exactly once, and (2) the case when values may be recomputed as necessary. The completeness of the third problem considered is surprising. A straight line program starts with a set of initial values, and computes intermediate and final values. Suppose, for each value, the register that value must be computed into is preassigned. Then, (3) the problem of determining if there is a computation of the straight line program, that computes values into the assigned registers, is polynomial complete.},
