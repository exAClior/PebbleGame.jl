  abstract = {Trees in an n-node forest are merged according to instructions in a given sequence, while other instructions in the sequence ask for the lowest common ancestor of pairs of nodes. We show that any sequence of \$O(n)\$ such instructions can be processed “on-line” in \$O(n\textbackslash log n)\$ steps on a random access computer.If we can accept our answer “off-line”, that is, no answers need to be produced until the entire sequence of instructions has been seen, then we may perform the task in \$O(n\textbackslash alpha (n))\$ steps, where \$\textbackslash alpha (n)\$ is the very slowly growing inverse Ackermann function defined in [14].A third algorithm solves a problem of intermediate complexity. We require the answers on-line, but we assume that all tree merging instructions precede the information requests. This algorithm requires \$O(n \textbackslash log \textbackslash log n)\$ time.We apply the first on-line algorithm to a problem in code optimization, that of computing immediate dominators in a reducible flow graph. We show how this computation can be performed in \$O(n\textbackslash log n)\$ steps.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of CNOT -optimal quantum circuit synthesis over gate sets consisting of CNOT and Z-basis rotations of arbitrary angles. We show that the circuit-polynomial correspondence relates such circuits to Fourier expansions of pseudo-Boolean functions, and that for certain classes of functions this expansion uniquely determines the minimum CNOT cost of an implementation. As a corollary we prove that CNOT minimization over CNOT and phase gates is at least as hard as synthesizing a CNOT -optimal circuit computing a set of parities of its inputs. We then show that this problem is NP-complete for two restricted cases where all CNOT gates are required to have the same target, and where the circuit inputs are encoded in a larger state space. The latter case has applications to CNOT optimization over more general Clifford+T circuits. We further present an efficient heuristic algorithm for synthesizing circuits over CNOT and Z-basis rotations with small CNOT cost. Our experiments show a 23\% reduction of CNOT gates on average across a suite of Clifford+T benchmark circuits, with a maximum reduction of 43\%.},

  abstract = {We consider the time and space required for quantum computers to solve a wide variety of problems involving matrices, many of which have only been analyzed classically in prior work. Our main results show that for a range of linear algebra problems -- including matrix-vector product, matrix inversion, matrix multiplication and powering -- existing classical time-space tradeoffs, several of which are tight for every space bound, also apply to quantum algorithms. For example, for almost all matrices \$A\$, including the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, we prove that quantum circuits with at most \$T\$ input queries and \$S\$ qubits of memory require \$T=\textbackslash Omega(n\textasciicircum 2/S)\$ to compute matrix-vector product \$Ax\$ for \$x \textbackslash in \textbackslash\{0,1\textbackslash\}\textasciicircum n\$. We similarly prove that matrix multiplication for \$n\textbackslash times n\$ binary matrices requires \$T=\textbackslash Omega(n\textasciicircum 3 / \textbackslash sqrt\{S\})\$. Because many of our lower bounds match deterministic algorithms with the same time and space complexity, we show that quantum computers cannot provide any asymptotic advantage for these problems with any space bound. We obtain matching lower bounds for the stronger notion of quantum cumulative memory complexity -- the sum of the space per layer of a circuit. We also consider Boolean (i.e. AND-OR) matrix multiplication and matrix-vector products, improving the previous quantum time-space tradeoff lower bounds for \$n\textbackslash times n\$ Boolean matrix multiplication to \$T=\textbackslash Omega(n\textasciicircum\{2.5\}/S\textasciicircum\{1/4\})\$ from \$T=\textbackslash Omega(n\textasciicircum\{2.5\}/S\textasciicircum\{1/2\})\$. Our improved lower bound for Boolean matrix multiplication is based on a new coloring argument that extracts more from the strong direct product theorem used in prior work. Our tight lower bounds for linear algebra problems require adding a new bucketing method to the recording-query technique of Zhandry that lets us apply classical arguments to upper bound the success probability of quantum circuits.},

The price for a better scalability compared to functional synthesis approaches is the requirement for many additional qubits to store temporary results of the hierarchical input representation. However, implementing a quantum circuit with large number of qubits is a major hurdle. In this paper, we demonstrate and establish how reversible pebble games can be used to reduce the number of stored temporary results, thereby reducing the qubit count. Our proposed algorithm can be constrained with number of qubits, which is aimed to meet. Experimental studies show that the qubit count can be significantly reduced (by up to 63.2\%) compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, at the cost of additional gate count.},

  abstract = {The classical (parallel) black pebbling game is a useful abstraction which allows us to analyze the resources (space, space-time, cumulative space) necessary to evaluate a function f with a static data-dependency graph G. Of particular interest in the field of cryptography are data-independent memory-hard functions fG,H which are defined by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G and a cryptographic hash function H. The pebbling complexity of the graph G characterizes the amortized cost of evaluating fG,H multiple times as well as the total cost to run a brute-force preimage attack over a fixed domain X, i.e., given y∈\{0,1\}∗ find x∈X such that fG,H(x)=y. While a classical attacker will need to evaluate the function fG,H at least m=|X| times a quantum attacker running Grover's algorithm only requires O(m) blackbox calls to a quantum circuit CG,H evaluating the function fG,H. Thus, to analyze the cost of a quantum attack it is crucial to understand the space-time cost (equivalently width times depth) of the quantum circuit CG,H. We first observe that a legal black pebbling strategy for the graph G does not necessarily imply the existence of a quantum circuit with comparable complexity --- in contrast to the classical setting where any efficient pebbling strategy for G corresponds to an algorithm with comparable complexity for evaluating fG,H. Motivated by this observation we introduce a new parallel reversible pebbling game which captures additional restrictions imposed by the No-Deletion Theorem in Quantum Computing. We apply our new reversible pebbling game to analyze the reversible space-time complexity of several important graphs: Line Graphs, Argon2i-A, Argon2i-B, and DRSample. Specifically, (1) we show that a line graph of size N has reversible space-time complexity at most O(N1+2log⁡N). (2) We show that any (e,d)-reducible DAG has reversible space-time complexity at most O(Ne+dN2d). In particular, this implies that the reversible space-time complexity of Argon2i-A and Argon2i-B are at most O(N2log⁡log⁡N/log⁡N) and O(N2/log⁡N3), respectively. (3) We show that the reversible space-time complexity of DRSample is at most O(N2log⁡log⁡N/log⁡N). We also study the cumulative pebbling cost of reversible pebblings extending a (non-reversible) pebbling attack of Alwen and Blocki on depth-reducible graphs.},

We prove that the problem of deciding whether s pebbles suffice to reversibly pebble a DAG G is PSPACE-complete, as was previously shown for the standard pebble game in [Gilbert, Lengauer and Tarjan '80]. Via two different graph product constructions we then strengthen these results to establish that both standard and reversible pebbling space are PSPACE-hard to approximate to within any additive constant. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first hardness of approximation results for pebble games in an unrestricted setting (even for polynomial time). Also, since [Chan '13] proved that reversible pebbling is equivalent to the games in [Dymond and Tompa '85] and [Raz and McKenzie '99], our results apply to the Dymond – Tompa and Raz – McKenzie games as well, and from the same paper it follows that resolution depth is PSPACE-hard to determine up to any additive constant. We also obtain a multiplicative logarithmic separation between reversible and standard pebbling space. This improves on the additive logarithmic separation previously known and could plausibly be tight, although we are not able to prove this. We leave as an interesting open problem whether our additive hardness of approximation result could be strengthened to a multiplicative bound if the computational resources are decreased from polynomial space to the more common setting of polynomial time.},

  abstract = {The red-blue pebble game was formulated in the 1980s\textasciitilde\textbackslash citeHK81 to model the I/O complexity of algorithms on a two-level memory hierarchy. Given a directed acyclic graph representing computations (vertices) and their dependencies (edges), the red-blue pebble game allows sequentially adding, removing, and recoloring red or blue pebbles according to a few rules, where red pebbles represent data in cache (fast memory) and blue pebbles represent data on disk (slow, external memory). Specifically, a vertex can be newly pebbled red if and only if all of its predecessors currently have a red pebble; pebbles can always be removed; and pebbles can be recolored between red and blue (corresponding to reading or writing data between disk and cache, also called I/Os or memory transfers). Given an upper bound on the number of red pebbles at any time (the cache size), the goal is to compute a game execution with the fewest pebble recolorings (memory transfers) that finish with pebbles on a specified subset of nodes (outputs get computed). In this paper, we investigate the complexity of computing this trade-off between red-pebble limit (cache size) and number of recolorings (memory transfers) in general DAGs. First we prove this problem PSPACE-complete through an extension of the proof PSPACE-hardness of black pebbling complexity\textasciitilde\textbackslash citeGLT80. Second, we consider a natural restriction on the red-blue pebble game to forbid pebble deletions, or equivalently, forbid discarding data from cache without first writing it to disk. This assumption both simplifies the model and immediately places the trade-off computation problem within NP. Unfortunately, we show that even this restricted version is NP-complete. Finally, we show that the trade-off problem parameterized by the number of transitions is W[1]-hard, meaning that there is likely no algorithm running in a fixed polynomial for constant number of transitions.},

  abstract = {Automated reasoning tools for the verification and synthesis of software often produce proofs to allow independent certification of the correctness of the produced solutions. As proofs can be large, this paper considers the problem of compressing proofs with respect to their space, which is approximately proportional to the memory necessary to check them. Proof checking with a small amount of available memory is analogous to playing a pebbling game with a small number of pebbles. This paper exploits this analogy and describes novel algorithms for playing a pebbling game. The sequence of moves executed in the pebbling game then corresponds to an improved topological ordering of the nodes of the proof, leading to smaller memory consumption when the proof is checked. Because the number of possible pebbling strategies and topological orderings is too large, brute-force approaches to find optimal solutions are impractical, and hence, the new pebbling algorithms proposed here are based on heuristics for finding good, though not necessarily optimal, solutions. The algorithms are evaluated on the task of compressing the space of thousands of propositional resolution proofs generated by SAT- and SMT-solvers.},

  abstract = {We study scheduling of computation graphs to minimize peak memory consumption, an increasingly critical task due to the surge in popularity of large deep-learning models. This problem corresponds to the weighted version of the classical one-shot black pebbling game. We propose the notion of a dominant schedule to capture the idea of finding the ``best'' schedule for a subgraph and introduce new tools to compute and utilize dominant schedules. Surprisingly, we show that despite the strong requirements, a dominant schedule exists for any computation graph; and, moreover, that it is possible to compute the dominant schedule efficiently whenever we can find optimal schedules efficiently for a particular class of graphs (under mild technical conditions). We apply these new tools to analyze trees and series-parallel graphs. We show that the weighted one-shot black pebbling game is strongly NP-complete even when the graph is an out-tree -- or simpler still, a pumpkin, one of the simplest series-parallel graphs. On the positive side, we design a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to find a dominant schedule (hence also a peak memory minimizing schedule) for series-parallel graphs when parameterized by the out-degree. This algorithm runs in time \$2\textasciicircum\{O(d \textbackslash log d)\} \textbackslash cdot poly(n)\$ for series-parallel graphs with \$n\$ nodes and maximum out-degree \$d\$; for pumpkins, we can improve the dependence on \$d\$ to \$O(2\textasciicircum d \textbackslash cdot poly(n))\$.},

  abstract = {Pebble games are popular models for analyzing time-space trade-offs. In particular, reversible pebble game strategies are frequently applied in quantum algorithms like Grover’s search to efficiently simulate classical computation on inputs in superposition, as unitary operations are fundamentally reversible. However, the reversible pebble game cannot harness the additional computational power granted by intermediate measurements, which are irreversible. The spooky pebble game, which models interleaved Hadamard basis measurements and adaptive phase corrections, reduces the number of qubits beyond what purely reversible approaches can achieve. While the spooky pebble game does not reduce the total space (bits plus qubits) complexity of the simulation, it reduces the amount of space that must be stored in qubits. We prove asymptotically tight trade-offs for the spooky pebble game on a line with any pebble bound. This in turn gives a tight time-qubit tradeoff for simulating arbitrary classical sequential computation when using the spooky pebble game. For example, for all ε ∈ (0, 1], any classical computation requiring time T and space S can be implemented on a quantum computer using only O(T /ε) gates and O(T εS1−ε) qubits. This improves on the best known bound for the reversible pebble game with that number of qubits, which uses O(21/εT ) gates. For smaller space bounds, we show that the spooky pebble game can simulate arbitrary computation with O(T 1+εS−ε/ε) gates and O(S/ε) qubits whereas any simulation via the reversible pebble game requires Ω(S · (1 + log(T /S))) qubits.},

Introduced by Bennett, a reversible pebble game is an abstraction of reversible computation that allows to examine the space and time complexity of various classes of problems. We present a technique for proving lower and upper bounds on time and space complexity for several types of graphs. Using this technique we show that the time needed to achieve optimal space for chain topology is Ω(n lg n) for infinitely many n and we discuss time-space trade-offs for chain. Further we show a tight optimal space bound for the binary tree of height h of the form h + Θ(lg∗ h) and discuss space complexity for the butterfly. These results give an evidence that reversible computations need more resources than standard computations. We also show an upper bound on time and space complexity of the reversible pebble game based on the time and space complexity of the standard pebble game, regardless of the topology of the graph.},

The question of when to rematerialize, i.e., to recompute intermediate values rather than retaining them in memory, becomes critical to achieving the best time and space efficiency.  In this work we consider the rematerialization problem and devise efficient algorithms that use structural characterizations of computation graphs---treewidth and pathwidth---to obtain provably efficient rematerialization schedules. Our experiments demonstrate the performance of these algorithms on many common deep learning models.},

To achieve this, we use the red-blue pebble game to precisely model MMM dependencies and derive a constructive and tight sequential and parallel I/O lower bound proofs. Compared to 2D or 3D algorithms, which fix processor decomposition upfront and then map it to the matrix dimensions, it reduces communication volume by up to √ times. COSMA outperforms the established ScaLAPACK, CARMA, and CTF algorithms in all scenarios up to 12.8x (2.2x on average), achieving up to 88\% of Piz Daint's peak performance.

  abstract = {Future miniaturization and mobilization of computing devices requires energy parsimonious `adiabatic' computation. This is contingent on logical reversibility of computation. An example is the idea of quantum computations which are reversible except for the irreversible observation steps. We propose to study quantitatively the exchange of computational resources like time and space for irreversibility in computations. Reversible simulations of irreversible computations are memory intensive. Such (polynomial time) simulations are analysed here in terms of `reversible' pebble games. We show that Bennett's pebbling strategy uses least additional space for the greatest number of simulated steps. We derive a trade-off for storage space versus irreversible erasure. Next we consider reversible computation itself. An alternative proof is provided for the precise expression of the ultimate irreversibility cost of an otherwise reversible computation without restrictions on time and space use. A time-irreversibility trade-off hierarchy in the exponential time region is exhibited. Finally, extreme time-irreversibility trade-offs for reversible computations in the thoroughly unrealistic range of computable versus noncomputable time-bounds are given.},

The only existing automatic method for quantum states clean-up relies on the availability of many extra resources. In this work, we propose an automatic tool for quantum memory management. We show how this problem exactly matches the reversible pebbling game. Based on that, we develop a SAT-based algorithm that returns a valid clean-up strategy, taking the limitations of the quantum hardware into account. The developed tool empowers the designer with the flexibility required to explore the trade-off between memory resources and number of operations. We present three show-cases to prove the validity of our approach. First, we apply the algorithm to straight-line programs, widely used in cryptographic applications. Second, we perform a comparison with the existing approach, showing an average improvement of 52.77\%. Finally, we show the advantage of using the tool when synthesizing a quantum circuit on a constrained near-term quantum device.},

  abstract = {The prospective of practical quantum computers has lead researchers to investigate automatic tools to program them. A quantum program is modeled as a Clifford+T quantum circuit that needs to be optimized in order to comply with quantum technology constraints. Most of the optimization algorithms aim at reducing the number of T gates. Nevertheless, a secondary optimization objective should be to minimize the number of two-qubit operations (the CNOT gates) as they show lower fidelity and higher error rate when compared to single-qubit operations. We have developed an exact SAT-based algorithm for quantum circuit rewriting that aims at reducing CNOT gates without increasing the number of T gates. Our algorithm finds the minimum \{CNOT, T\} circuit for a given phase polynomial description of a unitary transformation. Experiments confirm a reduction of CNOT in T-optimized quantum circuits. We synthesize quantum circuits for all single-target gates whose control functions are one of the representatives of the 48 spectral equivalence classes of all 5-input Boolean functions. Our experiments show an average CNOT reduction of 26.84\%.},

  abstract = {Computational complexity is one of the most beautiful fields of modern mathematics, and it is increasingly relevant to other sciences ranging from physics to biology. But this beauty is often buried underneath layers of unnecessary formalism, and exciting recent results like interactive proofs, phase transitions, and quantum computing are usually considered too advanced for the typical student. This book bridges these gaps by explaining the deep ideas of theoretical computer science in a clear and enjoyable fashion, making them accessible to non-computer scientists and to computer scientists who finally want to appreciate their field from a new point of view. The authors start with a lucid and playful explanation of the P vs. NP problem, explaining why it is so fundamental, and so hard to resolve. They then lead the reader through the complexity of mazes and games; optimization in theory and practice; randomized algorithms, interactive proofs, and pseudorandomness; Markov chains and phase transitions; and the outer reaches of quantum computing. At every turn, they use a minimum of formalism, providing explanations that are both deep and accessible. The book is intended for graduate and undergraduate students, scientists from other areas who have long wanted to understand this subject, and experts who want to fall in love with this field all over again.},

We first study the relationship between previously introduced red-blue pebble models (base, oneshot, nodel). We also analyze a new variant (compcost) to obtain a more realistic model of computation. We then prove that red-blue pebbling is NP-hard in all of these model variants. Furthermore, we show that in the oneshot model, a δ-approximation algorithm for δ{$<$}2 is only possible if the unique games conjecture is false. Finally, we show that greedy algorithms are not good candidates for approximation, since they can return significantly worse solutions than the optimum.},

Since then, many variants of the problem have been considered; depending on two factors: (1) the particular model for registers, and (2) the definition of the term “computation of a program” e.g. whether values may be computed more than once. We will show that several variants of the register allocation problem for straight line programs are polynomial complete. In particular we consider, (1) the case when each value is computed exactly once, and (2) the case when values may be recomputed as necessary. The completeness of the third problem considered is surprising. A straight line program starts with a set of initial values, and computes intermediate and final values. Suppose, for each value, the register that value must be computed into is preassigned. Then, (3) the problem of determining if there is a computation of the straight line program, that computes values into the assigned registers, is polynomial complete.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in quantum hardware indicate that systems featuring more than 50 physical qubits are within reach. At this scale, classical simulation will no longer be feasible and there is a possibility that such quantum devices may outperform even classical supercomputers at certain tasks. With the rapid growth of qubit numbers and coherence times comes the increasingly difficult challenge of quantum program compilation. This entails the translation of a high-level description of a quantum algorithm to hardware-specific low-level operations which can be carried out by the quantum device. Some parts of the calculation may still be performed manually due to the lack of efficient methods. This, in turn, may lead to a design gap, which will prevent the programming of a quantum computer. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in fully-automatic quantum compilation. We motivate directions for future research to tackle these challenges. Yet, with the algorithms and approaches that exist today, we demonstrate how to automatically perform the quantum programming flow from algorithm to a physical quantum computer for a simple algorithmic benchmark, namely the hidden shift problem. We present and use two tool flows which invoke RevKit. One which is based on ProjectQ and which targets the IBM Quantum Experience or a local simulator, and one which is based on Microsoft's quantum programming language Q\#.},

Any probabilistic Turing machine (PTM) which runs in space s and which halts absolutely (i.e. halts with certainty after a finite number of steps) can be simulated in space O(s) by a quantum Turing machine (QTM). If the PTM operates with bounded error, then the QTM may be taken to operate with bounded error as well, although the QTM may not halt absolutely in this case. In the unbounded error case, the QTM may be taken to halt absolutely. 2. Any QTM running in space s can be simulated by an unbounded error PTM running in space O(s). No assumptions on the probability of error or Turing time for the QTM are required, but it is assumed that all transition amplitudes of the quantum machine are rational. It follows that unbounded error, space O(s) bounded quantum Turing machines and probabilistic Turing machines are equivalent in power. This implies that any space s QTM can be simulated deterministically in space O(s/sup 2/), and further that any (unbounded-error) QTM running in log-space can be simulated in NC/sup 2/ We also consider quantum analogues of nondeterministic and one-sided error probabilistic space-bounded classes, and prove some simple relationships regarding these classes.},
