# Purpose

Computing should be done as fast as possible with as little resources as
possible. Current focus of hardware seems to be more on the speed of computation
rather than on more fast memory. In ref (3) of notes
<cite:&marchalPartPebblegameModels>.

The pebble game is a tool to analyze the space-time complexity of a computer
program. The goal is to find the optimal order for the instructions in a program
to minimize the space-time complexity.
